               title: 'John Hogg was a building inspector, then District Building Controller in Wanganui 1983 - 2001. Though for much of that time untreated radiata was approved for use in structural framing, Mr Hogg essentially disallowed it on his watch. This was despite stiff resistance from the local building industry. He thus substantially mitigated the effects of the leaky buildings disaster in Wanganui. The Wanganui District Council later wrote this letter of commendation'
